# Flash Vocab

Flash Vocab is a term memorization app that uses different strategies to quickly and effectively memorize terms and their definitions. 

## Progress and Future Updates
Current status: The app is fully functional and includes all the capabilities to create and edit lists and practice them with flashcards, a single term rapid-fire (flash) quiz, and a full length standard quiz. 

In Progress: Create a grouping page and medley mode. The grouping page will allow you to manually or automatically (with integrated AI) sort terms in a list into groups of 4 or 5 (the optimal grouping for term memorization) based on similarity. Medley mode will allow you to practice in these groupings with a combination of flashcards, multiple choice questions, flash quizzes, and a final full length quiz.
